# Financial Advisor Assistant

A sample Gemini CLI project that turns Gemini into a friendly financial planning helper. It's like having a consultant, but one who won't tell you to invest everything in a frozen banana stand.

## What This Does

When you run Gemini from this folder, it automatically loads instructions that make it act like a patient, jargon-free financial advisor. Great for:

- Thinking through retirement savings (not Costanza's approach)
- Making a budget (Serenity now, financial stability later)
- Understanding investment basics
- Setting savings goals

DNA got me recognizing patterns in my spending. This AI will too.

## How to Use It

### 1. Navigate to this folder

```bash
cd ~/mr-robot/projects/financial-advisor
```

Or if you cloned this repo somewhere else, navigate there.

### 2. Start Gemini

```bash
gemini
```

That's it. Gemini will automatically read the `GEMINI.md` file and know how to behave. Like the robot, it just knows.

## Example Prompts to Try

**Start simple:**
```
I make $60,000 a year and want to start saving for retirement. Where do I begin?
```

**Get specific:**
```
What's the difference between a 401k and an IRA? Explain it like I'm at a Bluth family meeting.
```

**Make a plan:**
```
Help me create a monthly budget. I make $4,000/month after taxes. I need to stop buying shirts that look like other stuff.
```

**Understand concepts:**
```
Explain compound interest with a simple example. Make it hit like a DOOM verse.
```

## What to Expect

Gemini will:
- Ask clarifying questions instead of making assumptions
- Explain things in plain English (no "synergy" or "leverage")
- Break down complex topics into simple steps
- Remind you that this isn't professional financial advice

It won't tell you there's always money in the banana stand. Because there isn't. It was a metaphor. And then it was cash. And then it burned.

## Customize It

Want to change how the assistant behaves? Edit the `GEMINI.md` file in this folder. Try:

- Changing the tone (more formal, more casual, more Paulie Walnuts)
- Adding specific topics you want it to focus on
- Including your personal financial situation for context

People can change.
